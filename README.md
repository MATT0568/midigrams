# Midigrams

A music generator using an ngram model

## Getting Started

Not currently hosted therefore you must hav nodejs, perl, and npm installed for this to run. 
If so then you can use the command npm start.

You can then generate probability based midi tracks.
You may also look at the probabilities used and the generated tracks json data.
There is also another repository that contains the script without the react app which can be used to generate midi tracks with the command node midi.js. This also requires the user to have node and perl installed.
